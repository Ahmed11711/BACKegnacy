# Missing Views Created

## What I Created

I've created the **User management views** to fix the immediate error:

✅ `resources/views/admin/users/index.blade.php` - List all users
✅ `resources/views/admin/users/create.blade.php` - Create user form
✅ `resources/views/admin/users/edit.blade.php` - Edit user form
✅ `resources/views/admin/users/show.blade.php` - View user details

## Still Need to Create

The following views are still needed for other controllers:

### Products
- `resources/views/admin/products/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/products/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/products/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/products/show.blade.php`

### Categories
- `resources/views/admin/categories/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/categories/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/categories/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/categories/show.blade.php`

### Services
- `resources/views/admin/services/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/services/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/services/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/services/show.blade.php`

### Bundles
- `resources/views/admin/bundles/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/bundles/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/bundles/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/bundles/show.blade.php`

### Settings
- `resources/views/admin/settings/index.blade.php`

### Activity Logs
- `resources/views/admin/activity-logs/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/admin/activity-logs/show.blade.php`

### Orders & Payments
- `resources/views/orders/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/orders/create.blade.php`
- `resources/views/orders/show.blade.php`
- `resources/views/payments/index.blade.php`
- `resources/views/payments/show.blade.php`

## Current Status

✅ User views created - Users management should work now!
⏳ Other views needed - Will show errors until created

## Next Steps

You can now:
1. Access Users management: `/admin/users`
2. Create, edit, view, and delete users
3. Other admin pages will need views created

Would you like me to create all the remaining views?
