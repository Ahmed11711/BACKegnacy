# Where Are The Rest of The Files?

## What You Have (Application Code)

I've created **only the custom application code** for your Laravel project. This includes:

✅ **Custom Application Files:**
- Models (10 files)
- Controllers (9 files)
- Migrations (12 files)
- Requests (7 validation files)
- Resources (9 API resource files)
- Services (3 service classes)
- Traits (1 trait)
- Middleware (1 middleware)
- Seeders (7 files)
- Factories (3 files)
- Routes (api.php)
- Providers (AppServiceProvider.php)
- Kernel.php

**Total: ~67 custom application files**

## What's Missing (Laravel Framework Files)

The standard Laravel framework files are **NOT included** because they come from a fresh Laravel installation. These include:

❌ **Missing Standard Laravel Files:**
- `composer.json` - Dependency management
- `package.json` - Frontend dependencies
- `artisan` - Laravel command-line tool
- `.env.example` - Environment configuration template
- `phpunit.xml` - Testing configuration
- `vite.config.js` / `webpack.mix.js` - Frontend build config
- `config/` directory - All configuration files (database, app, cache, etc.)
- `bootstrap/` directory - Application bootstrap files
- `public/` directory - Public web root (index.php, .htaccess, etc.)
- `resources/` directory - Views, lang, css, js (if needed)
- `storage/` directory structure - File storage directories
- `tests/` directory - PHPUnit tests structure
- `vendor/` directory - Composer dependencies (generated)
- `node_modules/` directory - NPM dependencies (generated)

## Solution: Integrate Into a Fresh Laravel Project

You have **two options**:

### Option 1: Create New Laravel Project (Recommended)

1. **Create a new Laravel project** in a different location:
```bash
cd C:\laragon\www\new-company
composer create-project laravel/laravel my-laravel-api
cd my-laravel-api
```

2. **Install Laravel Sanctum**:
```bash
composer require laravel/sanctum
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Sanctum\SanctumServiceProvider"
php artisan migrate
```

3. **Copy all files from `laravel-backend/`** into the new Laravel project:
   - Copy `app/` folder contents → merge into `app/`
   - Copy `database/` folder contents → merge into `database/`
   - Copy `routes/api.php` → replace the existing `routes/api.php`

4. **Run migrations and seeders**:
```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan storage:link
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup (If you already have a Laravel project)

If you already have a Laravel project, simply copy the files from `laravel-backend/` into your existing project structure.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Navigate to your Laravel project directory**

2. **Install Sanctum** (if not already installed):
```bash
composer require laravel/sanctum
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Sanctum\SanctumServiceProvider"
php artisan migrate
```

3. **Copy files** (merge directories, don't replace):
   - `laravel-backend/app/*` → `your-project/app/*`
   - `laravel-backend/database/*` → `your-project/database/*`
   - `laravel-backend/routes/api.php` → `your-project/routes/api.php`

4. **Update `config/sanctum.php`** (add to `stateful` array):
```php
'stateful' => explode(',', env('SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS', sprintf(
    '%s%s',
    'localhost,localhost:3000,127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1:8000,::1',
    env('APP_URL') ? ','.parse_url(env('APP_URL'), PHP_URL_HOST) : ''
))),
```

5. **Update `.env`**:
```env
SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=localhost:3000,127.0.0.1:3000
SESSION_DOMAIN=localhost
```

6. **Run setup**:
```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan storage:link
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

## Summary

**What you have:** Custom application code (models, controllers, migrations, etc.)
**What you need:** A fresh Laravel installation to integrate these files into
**Solution:** Create a new Laravel project and copy/merge these files into it

The files in `laravel-backend/` are **not a complete Laravel project** - they are the **custom application code** that goes **inside** a Laravel project.
